# Introduction

I've always been a visual learner finding that watching videos, reading posters and looking at diagrams to yield the most understanding and ability to recall information. In this post, I will be looking at ways to visualise `dplyr` functions with the possible extension to general data manipulation. There's no real need for this, arguably it is just an excuse to make some animations using `python` but I do think testing new ways to convey information is at the very least worth a shot.
