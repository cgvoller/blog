It is important to note that a **secondary use** (and not primary) is for HES to be used for *research*. Whilst there are steps to clean and have some data quality, there are concerns by the research community regarding the quality, completeness and coverage of HES records.\n\nResults from a bibliometric analysis of 520 studies extracted from PubMed showed the growth of HES data usage in publications from 1996 to 2014 with 1 publication found in 1996 and 99 found in 2014.\\@ref(Chaudhry329)\n\n![Cumulative growth of HES publications from 1996 to 2014](hes_pubs.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"815\"}\n\n# Annual HES data set\n\nAs mentioned, the primary purpose of HES is for hospital reimbursement. As such, each annual dataset is defined by the financial year (From 1 April to 31 March) and not by the calendar year.\n\n## The different data sets of HES\n\n\\[diagram of different data sets, subsets, etc\\]\n\n-   Admitted Patient Care (APC) - Details of episodes of care where a patient has been admitted into hospital (including regular day or night attending patients)\n\n-   Critical Care (CC) - A subset of APC data and consists of Adult Critical Care from 2008-09 onwards, with neonatal and paediatric CC included from 2017-18.\n\n    -   Each adult CC record represents a critical care period (from admission to discharge at a particular location)\n\n-   Outpatients (OP) - Collection of individual records of outpatient appointment in England. It includes information on:\n\n    -   Type of outpatient consultation\n\n    -   Appointment dates\n\n    -   Main specialty treatment specialty under which the patient was treated\n\n    -   Referral source\n\n    -   Waiting times\n\n-   Accident & Emergency (AE) - attendances recorded at major A&E departments, single specialty A&E departments, walk-in centres and minor injury units in England.\n\n    -   the Emergency Care dataset [ECDS](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/emergency-care-data-set-ecds) has now replaced AE as the official source of emergency care data, as of April 2020.\n\n-   The HES-ONS linked mortality dataset is created by linking mortality data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to patient information in HES. The HES database captures information on deaths only if they occurred in hospital.\n\n## Definition of an Episode and Spell\n\n-   Spell - Period of continuous care in one provider institution\n\n-   Episode - Periods of continuous care from a **single** consultant (as in one, we're not *too* concerned with the martial status of the good-looking physician who treated you).\n\n\\[Insert diagram of episodes within a spell\\]\n\nEach row in HES admitted patient care (APC) is a single episode which can be grouped into spells. A spell begins when a patient is admitted and ends when a patient has been discharges, transferred or dies.\n\n\\[example image of data frame\\]\n\nThings become increasingly complete when a patient is transferred to another NHS provider institution as a new spell is created with a new episode within it. For example,\n\n\\[insert image with CIP\\]\n\nHowever, a Continuous Inpatient Spell (CIP) is defined to encompass multiple spells.\n\nDiagnostic and procedure coding is entered by clinical coders written by the clinicians, when junior doctors are being trained they are reminded of the importance to get it correct on discharge summaries and to be clear on diagnosis of patients as there rules on what can/can't be coded. I.e., probable diabetes cannot be coded, only definitive diagnoses can be.\n\n# Data Cleaning & Derived Variables\n\n## ID change - August 2021 Update\n\nData cleaning and Derivations can be found [here](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics/hospital-episode-statistics-data-dictionary). From 2021, the patient identified in HES (HESID) changed to Master Person Service (MPS).\n\n# Useful Links\n\n-   [HES data and information (With data dictionary)](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics)\n\n-   [HES processing and data quality checks](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics/hes-processing-cycle-and-data-quality-checks)\n\n-   [Secondary Uses Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/secondary-uses-service-sus)\n\n-   [National Cost Collection for the NHS](https://www.england.nhs.uk/costing-in-the-nhs/national-cost-collection/)\n\n-   [Linked HES-ONS mortality data](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/linked-hes-ons-mortality-data)\n\n-   [ICD-10 Version 2019 Coding](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en)\n",
